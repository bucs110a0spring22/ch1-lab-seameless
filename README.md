## SUMMARY OF LATE POLICY FOR THE COURSE:
 Every student begins the semester with exactly five grace days. The days may be applied to any labs, other than the final lab. No additional extensions are given, and any late labs with no grace days used lose 10 percent from possible points. Any lab can still be submitted, up to the last day, for 50% credit.
